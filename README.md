# 2048

Yet another 2048 implementation

## Before you start

This project uses the following tools:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node/npm version
- [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to organize packages
- [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to run `@2024/game-engine` tests

## Getting started

First of all, you need to switch to the correct node version.

```sh
$ nvm use
# Found '/2048/.nvmrc' with version <v20.11.0>
# Now using node v20.11.0 (npm v10.2.4)
```

Then you can install project dependencies

```sh
$ npm ci
```
